# Operators in Python

Operators in Python are special symbols used to perform operations on variables and values. Python provides different types of operators:

## 1. Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

```python filename="main.py" {3} copy
a = 10
b = 3
print(a + b)  # Addition: 13
print(a - b)  # Subtraction: 7
print(a * b)  # Multiplication: 30
print(a / b)  # Division: 3.3333
print(a // b) # Floor Division: 3
print(a % b)  # Modulus: 1
print(a ** b) # Exponentiation: 1000
```

## 2. Comparison Operators
Comparison operators compare values and return Boolean results (True or False).

```python filename="main.py" {3} copy
x = 5
y = 10
print(x == y)  # False (Equal)
print(x != y)  # True (Not Equal)
print(x > y)   # False (Greater Than)
print(x < y)   # True (Less Than)
print(x >= y)  # False (Greater Than or Equal To)
print(x <= y)  # True (Less Than or Equal To)
```

## 3. Logical Operators
Logical operators combine multiple conditions and return Boolean results.

```python filename="main.py" {3} copy
p = True
q = False
print(p and q)  # False (Both must be True)
print(p or q)   # True (At least one is True)
print(not p)    # False (Negation)
```

## 4. Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operators perform operations at the binary level.

```python filename="main.py" {3} copy
x = 5  # 101 in binary
y = 3  # 011 in binary
print(x & y)  # AND: 1 (Bitwise AND)
print(x | y)  # OR: 7 (Bitwise OR)
print(x ^ y)  # XOR: 6 (Bitwise XOR)
print(~x)     # NOT: -6 (Bitwise Negation)
print(x << 1) # Left Shift: 10
print(x >> 1) # Right Shift: 2
```

## 5. Assignment Operators
Assignment operators assign values to variables and modify them using arithmetic operations.

```python filename="main.py" {3} copy
a = 10
a += 5  # Equivalent to a = a + 5
print(a)  # 15
```

## 6. Identity Operators
Identity operators check if two variables refer to the same object in memory.

```python filename="main.py" {3} copy
x = [1, 2, 3]
y = x
z = [1, 2, 3]
print(x is y)  # True (Same object)
print(x is z)  # False (Different objects with same values)
print(x is not z)  # True
```

## 7. Membership Operators
Membership operators check whether a value exists in a sequence.

```python filename="main.py" {3} copy
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(3 in nums)  # True (3 is in the list)
print(5 not in nums)  # True (5 is not in the list)
```

## Conclusion
Operators are fundamental in Python programming for performing computations, comparisons, and logical operations. Understanding them helps in writing efficient and effective programs.
