# Variables and Constants in Python

## Variables in Python
Variables store data values in memory. In Python, variable names can consist of letters, numbers, and underscores but cannot start with a number.

### Declaring Variables
```python filename="main.py" {3} copy
x = 5        # Integer
name = "Janak"  # String
pi = 3.14    # Float
is_active = True  # Boolean
```

### Multiple Assignments
```python filename="main.py" {3} copy
a, b, c = 10, 20, "Python"
print(a, b, c)  # 10 20 Python
```

### Variable Reassignment
Python allows reassigning variables with different data types.
```python filename="main.py" {3} copy
x = 10
x = "Hello"  # Now x holds a string
print(x)  # Hello
```

## Constants in Python
Python does not have built-in constant support, but constants are usually declared in uppercase by convention.

### Declaring Constants
```python filename="main.py" {3} copy
PI = 3.14159
GRAVITY = 9.8
```

### Using Constants
Constants help improve code readability and maintainability.
```python filename="main.py" {3} copy
radius = 5
area = PI * (radius ** 2)
print("Area of the circle:", area)
```

## Conclusion
Variables store data that can change during program execution, while constants hold fixed values by convention. Understanding their usage improves code efficiency and readability.
