# Conditional Statements in Python

Conditional statements allow a program to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. These statements control the flow of execution based on conditions evaluated as `True` or `False`.

## 1. if Statement
The `if` statement executes a block of code if the given condition is `True`.

```python filename="main.py" {3} copy
age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote.")
```

## 2. if-else Statement
The `if-else` statement provides an alternative block of code to execute when the condition is `False`.

```python filename="main.py" {3} copy
num = 10
if num % 2 == 0:
    print("Even number")
else:
    print("Odd number")
```

## 3. if-elif-else Statement
The `if-elif-else` statement checks multiple conditions and executes the first one that is `True`.

```python filename="main.py" {3} copy
score = 85
if score >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif score >= 80:
    print("Grade: B")
elif score >= 70:
    print("Grade: C")
else:
    print("Grade: F")
```

## 4. Nested if Statement
An `if` statement inside another `if` statement is called a nested `if`.

```python filename="main.py" {3} copy
x = 15
if x > 10:
    print("Greater than 10")
    if x > 20:
        print("Also greater than 20")
    else:
        print("But not greater than 20")
```

## Conclusion
Conditional statements are essential for decision-making in Python. They allow a program to execute different code based on specific conditions, making the program dynamic and responsive.
