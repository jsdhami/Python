# Loops in Python

Loops in Python are used to execute a block of code repeatedly as long as a certain condition is met. Python provides two main types of loops: `for` and `while` loops.

## 1. for Loop
The `for` loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, dictionary, or string) and execute a block of code for each element.

```python filename="main.py" {3} copy
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for num in numbers:
    print(num)
```

### Using range() with for Loop
The `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers.

```python filename="main.py" {3} copy
for i in range(5):  # Iterates from 0 to 4
    print("Iteration:", i)
```

## 2. while Loop
The `while` loop executes a block of code as long as the given condition is `True`.

```python filename="main.py" {3} copy
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print("Count:", count)
    count += 1
```

## 3. Nested Loops
A loop inside another loop is called a nested loop.

```python filename="main.py" {3} copy
for i in range(3):
    for j in range(2):
        print(f"i: {i}, j: {j}")
```

## 4. Loop Control Statements
Python provides loop control statements to modify the flow of loops:

### break Statement
The `break` statement stops the loop prematurely when a condition is met.

```python filename="main.py" {3} copy
for num in range(10):
    if num == 5:
        break  # Stops the loop when num is 5
    print(num)
```

### continue Statement
The `continue` statement skips the current iteration and moves to the next.

```python filename="main.py" {3} copy
for num in range(5):
    if num == 2:
        continue  # Skips when num is 2
    print(num)
```

### pass Statement
The `pass` statement is a placeholder that does nothing.

```python filename="main.py" {3} copy
for i in range(3):
    pass  # Placeholder for future code
```

## Conclusion
Loops are essential for automation and iterative processing in Python. Understanding their behavior helps in writing efficient and effective code.
